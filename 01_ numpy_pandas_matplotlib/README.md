# Pandas - Series

Pandas is a popular open-source data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures and functions that are designed to efficiently handle and analyze structured data, such as tables or spreadsheet-like data.

The key data structures in pandas are:

1. **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array that can hold data of any type. It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a single variable in statistics.

2. **DataFrame**: A two-dimensional labeled data structure that consists of columns, each of which can have a different data type. It is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. DataFrames are the primary data structure used in pandas and offer a powerful way to organize, manipulate, and analyze data.

Pandas provides a wide range of functions and methods for data manipulation and analysis. Some of the common operations you can perform with pandas include:

- Loading and saving data from various file formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, SQL databases).
- Cleaning and preprocessing data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types.
- Filtering, sorting, and selecting data based on specific criteria.
- Aggregating and summarizing data using grouping and aggregation functions.
- Joining, merging, and reshaping datasets.
- Computing descriptive statistics, correlations, and other data analysis metrics.
- Visualizing data using built-in plotting and visualization tools.

Pandas is highly flexible and provides a rich set of functionality, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and manipulation tasks. It is widely used in various fields, including data science, finance, economics, and research.

# Numpy: Numeric computing library

NumPy (Numerical Python) is one of the core packages for numerical computing in Python. Pandas, Matplotlib, Statmodels and many other Scientific libraries rely on NumPy.

NumPy major contributions are:

* Efficient numeric computation with C primitives
* Efficient collections with vectorized operations
* An integrated and natural Linear Algebra API
* A C API for connecting NumPy with libraries written in C, C++, or FORTRAN.

Let's develop on efficiency. In Python, **everything is an object**, which means that even simple ints are also objects, with all the required machinery to make object work. We call them "Boxed Ints". In contrast, NumPy uses primitive numeric types (floats, ints) which makes storing and computation efficient.

# Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web-based interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents called notebooks. It provides a flexible and intuitive interface for writing and executing code, visualizing data, and documenting your workflow.

Jupyter Notebook is widely used in data analysis, data science, research, and education. It promotes an iterative and interactive workflow, allowing you to explore and analyze data, prototype code, and document your work in a single environment. It is a powerful tool for data exploration, prototyping, and collaboration, making it popular among data scientists, researchers, and developers.
